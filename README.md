# IceMan Remastered

An industrial ice bagging machine control system built with PLC automation components.

## Overview

This project contains the control logic and configuration for an automated ice bagging system. The system handles ice production, bag feeding, sealing, and dispensing operations.

## System Components

### Core Components
- **Agitator** - Ice agitation and mixing
- **Bag Feeder** - Automated bag handling and positioning
- **Door** - Access control and safety interlocks
- **Heat Seal** - Bag sealing operations
- **Heater** - Temperature control systems
- **Hopper** - Ice storage and distribution
- **Ice Maker** - Ice production control
- **Kicker** - Bag ejection mechanism

### Control Systems
- **Machine Control** - Main system orchestration
- **Motion Control** - Motor and actuator coordination
- **Manual Control** - Operator interface and overrides
- **Fault Management** - Error handling and recovery
- **Temperature Control** - Thermal regulation

### I/O Systems
- Input/Output mapping and configuration
- Sensor interfaces (proximity, reflective)
- Motor control interfaces
- Safety and interlock systems

## Configuration

The system uses XML-based configuration files for:
- Component settings and parameters
- Sequence definitions
- I/O mappings
- Motor profiles
- Safety interlocks

## Development

This appears to be developed for industrial PLC systems, likely using:
- Structured Text (ST) programming language
- XML configuration management
- Component-based architecture

## Safety

⚠️ **Industrial Equipment Warning**: This system controls industrial machinery. Proper safety procedures and qualified personnel are required for installation and operation.
